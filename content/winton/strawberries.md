Thanks, Winton. Very much like Albany.

Tim Winton has a long record of making all sorts of contributions, be it plays, prose texts, short stories, etc. Last year, he got [a pretty big award](https://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-07/KB23%20-%20Honours%20List%20-%20Order%20of%20Australia%20%28General%20and%20Military%20Divisions%29%20Inc%20CHEYNE%20%282%29.pdf) as well! But, alas, we are not here to talk about Cloudstreet, or Breath, but instead I'm going to be talking about <u>The Turning</u> (2004). Which, in my totally humble opinion, ranks up there with his heavy hitters. 

<u>The Turning</u> is a pretty long anthology, so I'll definitely be talking about it again. But for now, I want to discuss my thoughts on just *two* of these short stories. <u>Damaged Goods</u> and <u>Long, Clear View</u>.

- Summary of both texts
The majority of short stories about Vic Lang, *arguably the protagonist of the whole anthology*, is told by Vic himself. But not <u>Damaged Goods</u>. Instead, we are introduced to "the girl with the strawberry birthmark" mentioned in <u>Long, Clear View</u> from the perspective of Gail, Vic's wife. Through the intimate 1st person perspective of Gail's narration, we learn of Vic's infatuation with "Strawberry Alison", stemming from his "adolescent attraction to the flawed and imperfect", and ultimately it is revealed that, years after graduating, Alison and her girlfriend had "hit a tree" which "incinerated them both". We gain perspective on Gail's personal struggle with Vic, with her recounting her sister's childish obsession with a doll, and finally alluding to the affair she reveals to Vic in the final story, <u>Defender</u>.

<u>Long, Clear View</u>, on the other hand, is narrated from the perspective of a young Vic Lang, who recounts the violence and crime that permeates life in Angelus. We learn that Vic's father, Bob, leaves the family, and the story ends with Vic clutching his father's rifle.

- Thesis: what does Long, Clear View and Damaged Goods talk about?
Personally, I think that Winton portrays life as a West Australian through the perspective of Vic. He thus reflects on the violent, disjoint nature of regional Australian culture, and on how Australian life is interwoven with tragedy and loss.

- Context of Australian masculinity
With Tim Winton being a West Australian author and all, it's probably best to talk about some recurring themes in his literature that are Australian specific. The one that comes to mind when reading <u>Long, Clear View</u> and <u>Damaged Goods</u> is the concept of Australian masculinity.

> Regional Australian masculinities are typified by ‘traditional’ values (e.g., stoicism, self-reliance) known to restrict social connectedness.

Throughout Australia's history, and most certainly through its literature, we get glimpses of the stereotypical "white Aussie bloke", the man of the house who struggles for the family, never showing any signs of weakness or vulnerability. Both of the short stories portray Vic as growing into this stereotype, and indicate that unstable, violent Australian society induces paranoia. Winton suggests that the unsafe social environment of rural Australia leads to the masculine traits we see from Vic, namely his fascination with defending himself and labouring for his family without complaint.

- Characterisation of Vic as fearful of an unknown and dangerous rural Australian community in Long, Clear View
- Portrayal of Vic as overprotective in Damaged Goods and Long, Clear View
- Intertextuality of Damaged Goods with Burning Sappho, link to general themes
- Conclusion
