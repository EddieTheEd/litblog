Thanks, Winton. Very much like Albany.

Tim Winton has a long record of making all sorts of contributions, be it plays, prose texts, short stories, etc. Last year, he got [a pretty big award](https://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-07/KB23%20-%20Honours%20List%20-%20Order%20of%20Australia%20%28General%20and%20Military%20Divisions%29%20Inc%20CHEYNE%20%282%29.pdf) as well! But, alas, we are not here to talk about Cloudstreet, or Breath, but instead I'm going to be talking about <u>The Turning</u> (2004). Which, in my totally humble opinion, ranks up there with his heavy hitters. 

<u>The Turning</u> is a pretty long anthology, so I'll definitely be talking about it again. But for now, I want to discuss my thoughts on just *two* of these short stories. <u>Damaged Goods</u> and <u>Long, Clear View</u>.

The majority of short stories about Vic Lang, *arguably the protagonist of the whole anthology*, is told by Vic himself. But not <u>Damaged Goods</u>. Instead, we are introduced to "the girl with the strawberry birthmark" mentioned in <u>Long, Clear View</u> from the perspective of Gail, Vic's wife. Through the intimate 1st person perspective of Gail's narration, we learn of Vic's infatuation with "Strawberry Alison", stemming from his "adolescent attraction to the flawed and imperfect", and ultimately it is revealed that, years after graduating, Alison and her girlfriend had "hit a tree" which "incinerated them both". We gain perspective on Gail's personal struggle with Vic, with her recounting her sister's childish obsession with a doll, and finally alluding to the affair she reveals to Vic in the final story, <u>Defender</u>.

<u>Long, Clear View</u>, on the other hand, is narrated from the perspective of a young Vic Lang, who recounts the violence and crime that permeates life in Angelus. We learn that Vic's father, Bob, leaves the family, and the story ends with Vic clutching his father's rifle.
